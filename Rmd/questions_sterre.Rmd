1. What to do if the wake up time is not provided? I was asked to check if the difference between 1st sample and wakeup time is < 15 minutes. If not I should make a note. When the wake up time is not provided we cannot know that difference and wondered how you handled that.

This criterium was not used. If we do not know, we assume it is correctly taken. 

2. When was a medication considered “systemic”? I was asked to exclude children who took systemic medications. Several of the infants for example take antihistamines. I am not aware of interaction with cortisol but those medications almost all have been shown to have system immune regulatory actions in some way that differs between the type of antihistamine.

if recipe, then not. 


3. What should I do in the following situations:  
- all samples of one day are provided on the correct or the same date but the wake up sample was forgotten and has been provided on a different day. Should I then exclude all those samples of that day, only the wake up sample or only keep the wake up sample or just keep all samples? 
exclude the samples from the wrong day. Reason: 

- What if e.g. half of the samples have been provided on the right day and half on another day? (e.g. ID 452)

there is no rule then 


- 227 Medication: Check type of injection?! ("Got his immunotherapy injections.") is not documented, ask Roseriet NOTE: if possible check illnesses at age 10, ask Roseriet
- 420 Two disease symptoms: Night before he went to the school party. He feels sick: diarrhea, abdominal pain. I still include this one because he obvisously played the soccer game...
- I need to ask Roseriet what I should do if one value is too late. Just exlude that one sample or exclude all values of the day? because I can imagine that for circadian cortisol e.g. the first sample is quite critical.
- ID: 409 it must have been a saturday based on notes, thus I changed date to 25 and 26 feb because is this closest weekend. Will ask Roseriet
- ID: 452 for both days samples have been provided on separate days and therefore I excluded them all.
