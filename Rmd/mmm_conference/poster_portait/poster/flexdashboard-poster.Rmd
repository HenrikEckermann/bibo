### **Introduction**

#### Research Question

- **Does attendance to center-based childcare alter gut microbiota composition?**

#### Motivation

- Gut microbial composition plays an important role in physical and mental health.

- Animal studies suggest: 
    - a sensitive period in early life with regard to the influence of microbes on the host.  
    - that early life stress disrupts the gut microbial ecosystem with negative health consequences.  
- Entering center based childcare can be considered an early life stressor in humans that leads to prolonged increases in cortisol levels as compared to caring in the home environment.

    
#### Contribution
- To investigate whether childcare attendance is a disruptive factor for the developing microbiota.


### **Results**

Here you would describe some amazing results.
Since this poster is about making a poster, I show the last poster.

**Fig. 1: Even the wisest cannot tell. For the mirror… shows many things…**
<img src="poster.png" alt="What will I see?" style="width:100%"></img>



```{r volcano-plot, fig.width=6, fig.height=3}
# Prepare a figure for later use
filled.contour(volcano)
```



#### Reproducible results with R

As we have come to expect, results from R computations can be included as well.
Since adjusting figure positions will be almost always necesary,
figures are by default saved to `output/img/` and not shown on the poster.
You need to manually include them using a <img> tag as shown below.

```html
**Fig. 1: Place the volcano figure where you please.**
<img src="img/volcano-plot-1.png" style="width:100%"></img>
```


#### Output for printing

A png file is produced by `scripts/render-poster.R`.
By default it is set to use a 300ppi resolution and A1 size.
For now, some testing is necessary to adjust scale and poster size.


### **Discussion**


```{r new-standard}
# Get reference image
download.file(
  "https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png", mode = "wb",
  destfile = "../output/img/standards.png"
)
```


Since there are so many tools that can be used to prepare posters,
and not a single one satisfies my needs,
I prepared this *other* tool to... nah it still is missing things.

<img src="img/standards.png" style="width:100%"></img>


#### Limitations

Since the png file is generated as a snapshot of the html poster,
several limitations should be considered:

- Resolution is very limited by the resources in your system
- Larger formats require much more resources to render
- Complex posters can take longer to load, so you have to try different delays
- The preview shown in `poster/poster_frame.html` could be very different to
the final rendered image
- "I can't fit enough text/figures!"  
  ↑ that one's on you, nobody likes a crammed poster
