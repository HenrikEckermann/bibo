sequencing. Sanger sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI; under the Community Sequencing Program) using standard protocols for the MegaBace4000 capillary electrophoresis platform. Sequences were assembled by PHRAP using XplorSeq (Frank 2008). 454 amplicon production was performed as previously described using barcoded 27F/338R primers targeting the V1/2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Hamady et al 2008). Sequencing was performed per manufacturer???s protocols using the 454 FLX system.</td><td>None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td><td>JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>FWD: GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td><td>27.96541                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td><td>454                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td><td>JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>guerrero_negro_microbial_mat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>\n",

Sanger sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI; under the Community Sequencing Program) using standard protocols for the MegaBace4000 capillary electrophoresis platform. Sequences were assembled by PHRAP using XplorSeq (Frank 2008). 454 amplicon production was performed as previously described using barcoded 27F/338R primers targeting the V1/2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Hamady et al 2008). Sequencing was performed per manufacturer???s protocols using the 454 FLX system.</td><td>None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td><td>JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>FWD: GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td><td>27.96541                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td><td>454                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td><td>JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>guerrero_negro_microbial_mat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>\n",

sequencing. Sanger sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI; under the Community Sequencing Program) using standard protocols for the MegaBace4000 capillary electrophoresis platform. Sequences were assembled by PHRAP using XplorSeq (Frank 2008). 454 amplicon production was performed as previously described using barcoded 27F/338R primers targeting the V1/2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Hamady et al 2008). Sequencing was performed per manufacturer???s protocols using the 454 FLX system.</td><td>None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td><td>JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>FWD: GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td><td>27.96541                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td><td>454                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td><td>JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>guerrero_negro_microbial_mat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>\n",

sequencing. Sanger sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI; under the Community Sequencing Program) using standard protocols for the MegaBace4000 capillary electrophoresis platform. Sequences were assembled by PHRAP using XplorSeq (Frank 2008). 454 amplicon production was performed as previously described using barcoded 27F/338R primers targeting the V1/2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Hamady et al 2008). Sequencing was performed per manufacturer???s protocols using the 454 FLX system.</td><td>None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td><td>JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>FWD: GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td><td>27.96541                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td><td>454                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td><td>JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>guerrero_negro_microbial_mat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>\n",

Sanger sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI; under the Community Sequencing Program) using standard protocols for the MegaBace4000 capillary electrophoresis platform. Sequences were assembled by PHRAP using XplorSeq (Frank 2008). 454 amplicon production was performed as previously described using barcoded 27F/338R primers targeting the V1/2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Hamady et al 2008). Sequencing was performed per manufacturer???s protocols using the 454 FLX system.</td><td>None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td><td>JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>FWD: GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td><td>27.96541                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td><td>454                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td><td>JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>guerrero_negro_microbial_mat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>\n",

Sanger sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI; under the Community Sequencing Program) using standard protocols for the MegaBace4000 capillary electrophoresis platform. Sequences were assembled by PHRAP using XplorSeq (Frank 2008). 454 amplicon production was performed as previously described using barcoded 27F/338R primers targeting the V1/2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Hamady et al 2008). Sequencing was performed per manufacturer???s protocols using the 454 FLX system.</td><td>None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td><td>JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>FWD: GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td><td>27.96541                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td><td>454                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td><td>JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>guerrero_negro_microbial_mat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>\n",

Sanger sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI; under the Community Sequencing Program) using standard protocols for the MegaBace4000 capillary electrophoresis platform. Sequences were assembled by PHRAP using XplorSeq (Frank 2008). 454 amplicon production was performed as previously described using barcoded 27F/338R primers targeting the V1/2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Hamady et al 2008). Sequencing was performed per manufacturer???s protocols using the 454 FLX system.</td><td>None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td><td>JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>FWD: GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td><td>27.96541                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td><td>454                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td><td>JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>guerrero_negro_microbial_mat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>\n",

sequencing. Sanger sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI; under the Community Sequencing Program) using standard protocols for the MegaBace4000 capillary electrophoresis platform. Sequences were assembled by PHRAP using XplorSeq (Frank 2008). 454 amplicon production was performed as previously described using barcoded 27F/338R primers targeting the V1/2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Hamady et al 2008). Sequencing was performed per manufacturer???s protocols using the 454 FLX system.</td><td>None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td><td>JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>FWD: GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td><td>27.96541                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td><td>454                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td><td>JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>guerrero_negro_microbial_mat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>\n",

sequencing. Sanger sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI; under the Community Sequencing Program) using standard protocols for the MegaBace4000 capillary electrophoresis platform. Sequences were assembled by PHRAP using XplorSeq (Frank 2008). 454 amplicon production was performed as previously described using barcoded 27F/338R primers targeting the V1/2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Hamady et al 2008). Sequencing was performed per manufacturer???s protocols using the 454 FLX system.</td><td>None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td><td>JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>FWD: GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td><td>27.96541                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td><td>454                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td><td>JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>guerrero_negro_microbial_mat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>\n",

Sanger sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI; under the Community Sequencing Program) using standard protocols for the MegaBace4000 capillary electrophoresis platform. Sequences were assembled by PHRAP using XplorSeq (Frank 2008). 454 amplicon production was performed as previously described using barcoded 27F/338R primers targeting the V1/2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Hamady et al 2008). Sequencing was performed per manufacturer???s protocols using the 454 FLX system. & None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & FWD: GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & 27.96541                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & 454                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & guerrero\\_negro\\_microbial\\_mat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \\\\\n",

Sanger sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI; under the Community Sequencing Program) using standard protocols for the MegaBace4000 capillary electrophoresis platform. Sequences were assembled by PHRAP using XplorSeq (Frank 2008). 454 amplicon production was performed as previously described using barcoded 27F/338R primers targeting the V1/2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Hamady et al 2008). Sequencing was performed per manufacturer???s protocols using the 454 FLX system. & None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & FWD: GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & 27.96541                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & 454                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & guerrero\\_negro\\_microbial\\_mat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \\\\\n",

Sanger sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI; under the Community Sequencing Program) using standard protocols for the MegaBace4000 capillary electrophoresis platform. Sequences were assembled by PHRAP using XplorSeq (Frank 2008). 454 amplicon production was performed as previously described using barcoded 27F/338R primers targeting the V1/2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Hamady et al 2008). Sequencing was performed per manufacturer???s protocols using the 454 FLX system. & None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & FWD: GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & 27.96541                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & 454                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & guerrero\\_negro\\_microbial\\_mat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \\\\\n",

Sanger sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI; under the Community Sequencing Program) using standard protocols for the MegaBace4000 capillary electrophoresis platform. Sequences were assembled by PHRAP using XplorSeq (Frank 2008). 454 amplicon production was performed as previously described using barcoded 27F/338R primers targeting the V1/2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Hamady et al 2008). Sequencing was performed per manufacturer???s protocols using the 454 FLX system. & None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & FWD: GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & 27.96541                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & 454                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & guerrero\\_negro\\_microbial\\_mat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \\\\\n",

Sanger sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI; under the Community Sequencing Program) using standard protocols for the MegaBace4000 capillary electrophoresis platform. Sequences were assembled by PHRAP using XplorSeq (Frank 2008). 454 amplicon production was performed as previously described using barcoded 27F/338R primers targeting the V1/2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Hamady et al 2008). Sequencing was performed per manufacturer???s protocols using the 454 FLX system. & None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & FWD: GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & 27.96541                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & 454                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & guerrero\\_negro\\_microbial\\_mat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \\\\\n",

Sanger sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI; under the Community Sequencing Program) using standard protocols for the MegaBace4000 capillary electrophoresis platform. Sequences were assembled by PHRAP using XplorSeq (Frank 2008). 454 amplicon production was performed as previously described using barcoded 27F/338R primers targeting the V1/2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Hamady et al 2008). Sequencing was performed per manufacturer???s protocols using the 454 FLX system. & None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & FWD: GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & 27.96541                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & 454                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & guerrero\\_negro\\_microbial\\_mat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \\\\\n",

Sanger sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI; under the Community Sequencing Program) using standard protocols for the MegaBace4000 capillary electrophoresis platform. Sequences were assembled by PHRAP using XplorSeq (Frank 2008). 454 amplicon production was performed as previously described using barcoded 27F/338R primers targeting the V1/2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Hamady et al 2008). Sequencing was performed per manufacturer???s protocols using the 454 FLX system. & None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & FWD: GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & 27.96541                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & 454                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & guerrero\\_negro\\_microbial\\_mat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \\\\\n",

Sanger sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI; under the Community Sequencing Program) using standard protocols for the MegaBace4000 capillary electrophoresis platform. Sequences were assembled by PHRAP using XplorSeq (Frank 2008). 454 amplicon production was performed as previously described using barcoded 27F/338R primers targeting the V1/2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Hamady et al 2008). Sequencing was performed per manufacturer???s protocols using the 454 FLX system. & None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & FWD: GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & 27.96541                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & 454                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & guerrero\\_negro\\_microbial\\_mat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \\\\\n",

Sanger sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI; under the Community Sequencing Program) using standard protocols for the MegaBace4000 capillary electrophoresis platform. Sequences were assembled by PHRAP using XplorSeq (Frank 2008). 454 amplicon production was performed as previously described using barcoded 27F/338R primers targeting the V1/2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Hamady et al 2008). Sequencing was performed per manufacturer???s protocols using the 454 FLX system. & None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & FWD: GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & 27.96541                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & 454                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & guerrero\\_negro\\_microbial\\_mat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \\\\\n",

Sanger sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI; under the Community Sequencing Program) using standard protocols for the MegaBace4000 capillary electrophoresis platform. Sequences were assembled by PHRAP using XplorSeq (Frank 2008). 454 amplicon production was performed as previously described using barcoded 27F/338R primers targeting the V1/2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Hamady et al 2008). Sequencing was performed per manufacturer???s protocols using the 454 FLX system. | None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | FWD: GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 27.96541                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 454                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | guerrero_negro_microbial_mat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | \n",

Sanger sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI; under the Community Sequencing Program) using standard protocols for the MegaBace4000 capillary electrophoresis platform. Sequences were assembled by PHRAP using XplorSeq (Frank 2008). 454 amplicon production was performed as previously described using barcoded 27F/338R primers targeting the V1/2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Hamady et al 2008). Sequencing was performed per manufacturer???s protocols using the 454 FLX system. | None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | FWD: GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 27.96541                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 454                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | guerrero_negro_microbial_mat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | \n",

Sanger sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI; under the Community Sequencing Program) using standard protocols for the MegaBace4000 capillary electrophoresis platform. Sequences were assembled by PHRAP using XplorSeq (Frank 2008). 454 amplicon production was performed as previously described using barcoded 27F/338R primers targeting the V1/2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Hamady et al 2008). Sequencing was performed per manufacturer???s protocols using the 454 FLX system. | None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | FWD: GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 27.96541                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 454                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | guerrero_negro_microbial_mat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | \n",

Sanger sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI; under the Community Sequencing Program) using standard protocols for the MegaBace4000 capillary electrophoresis platform. Sequences were assembled by PHRAP using XplorSeq (Frank 2008). 454 amplicon production was performed as previously described using barcoded 27F/338R primers targeting the V1/2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Hamady et al 2008). Sequencing was performed per manufacturer???s protocols using the 454 FLX system. | None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | FWD: GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 27.96541                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 454                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | guerrero_negro_microbial_mat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | \n",

Sanger sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI; under the Community Sequencing Program) using standard protocols for the MegaBace4000 capillary electrophoresis platform. Sequences were assembled by PHRAP using XplorSeq (Frank 2008). 454 amplicon production was performed as previously described using barcoded 27F/338R primers targeting the V1/2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Hamady et al 2008). Sequencing was performed per manufacturer???s protocols using the 454 FLX system. | None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | FWD: GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 27.96541                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 454                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | guerrero_negro_microbial_mat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | \n",

Sanger sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI; under the Community Sequencing Program) using standard protocols for the MegaBace4000 capillary electrophoresis platform. Sequences were assembled by PHRAP using XplorSeq (Frank 2008). 454 amplicon production was performed as previously described using barcoded 27F/338R primers targeting the V1/2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Hamady et al 2008). Sequencing was performed per manufacturer???s protocols using the 454 FLX system. | None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | FWD: GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 27.96541                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 454                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | guerrero_negro_microbial_mat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | \n",

Sanger sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI; under the Community Sequencing Program) using standard protocols for the MegaBace4000 capillary electrophoresis platform. Sequences were assembled by PHRAP using XplorSeq (Frank 2008). 454 amplicon production was performed as previously described using barcoded 27F/338R primers targeting the V1/2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Hamady et al 2008). Sequencing was performed per manufacturer???s protocols using the 454 FLX system. | None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | FWD: GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 27.96541                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 454                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | guerrero_negro_microbial_mat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | \n",

Sanger sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI; under the Community Sequencing Program) using standard protocols for the MegaBace4000 capillary electrophoresis platform. Sequences were assembled by PHRAP using XplorSeq (Frank 2008). 454 amplicon production was performed as previously described using barcoded 27F/338R primers targeting the V1/2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Hamady et al 2008). Sequencing was performed per manufacturer???s protocols using the 454 FLX system. | None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | FWD: GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 27.96541                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 454                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | guerrero_negro_microbial_mat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | \n",

Sanger sequencing was performed at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI; under the Community Sequencing Program) using standard protocols for the MegaBace4000 capillary electrophoresis platform. Sequences were assembled by PHRAP using XplorSeq (Frank 2008). 454 amplicon production was performed as previously described using barcoded 27F/338R primers targeting the V1/2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (Hamady et al 2008). Sequencing was performed per manufacturer???s protocols using the 454 FLX system. | None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | FWD: GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGTCAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG;REV:TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 27.96541                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 454                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | JGI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | guerrero_negro_microbial_mat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | \n",
